Role: Game Developer  
Duration: 2 months (May-June 2016)  
Team size: 5  
Platform: Google Draydream and GearVR  
Engine/Language: Unity/C#  

In this project, I developed early prototypes in GearVR, on initial stages of development. This was a great learning experience both for me and the development team, given that it was our first time developing a VR experience. We had to build the prototype from the ground up, given that at the time Unity3D didn't have a rich VR community and marketplace.
