Role: Development  
Intern Duration: 4 months  
Team size: 12~15, Scrum team  
Platform: Android and iOS  
Engine/Language: Unity3D/C#  

This was my first professional experience in Game Development. As a Development Intern in the company during the summer of 2013, I extended the Unity3D editor, creating a level editor tool in C# to speed up the creation of maps and enable server-side fine tuning of levels via JSON files.  In addition, I fixed gameplay bugs reported either by the QA team or by beta testers.
