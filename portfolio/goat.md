I worked on Let it Goat! remotely, from my hometown Aracaju, in Brazil. As a game developer, I:

*   Developed a multiplayer mode with a leaderboard system in which you could challenge other players;
*   Helped to build the game UI with NGUI (the standard at the time);
*   Implemented 2D assets (sprites, animations, parallax) with Toolkit2D;
*   Assisted the development of the (procedurally generated) level creation engine;
*   Adapted a version of the game to be launched in China.
