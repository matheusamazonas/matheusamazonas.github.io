Sphere Generator is a free Unity package/plugin that generates spheres (UV, cube and icospheres) of arbitrary detail levels procedurally. It's extremely useful when Unity's standard sphere mesh doesn't contain enough detail for your needs and/or you don't want to restrict yourself to pre-generated meshes. Its first version (1.0.0) was released in May 2024 and its latest version is [1.0.2](https://github.com/matheusamazonas/sphere_generator/releases/tag/1.0.2).
