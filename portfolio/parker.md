This was my last project at [Fantazm](https://www.fantazm.com). It was also my first solo full-stack game project, from conception to delivery. Parker - The Game is an online multiplayer turn-based team strategy game commissioned by [Event Creators](https://www.eventcreators.nl/) for their client [Parker Hannifin Netherlands](https://www.parker.com/nl/en/home.html).

You can read more about the project on the [postmortem I wrote about it](https://blog.matheusamazonas.net/posts/parker_postmortem).
