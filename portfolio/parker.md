This was my last project at [Fantazm](https://www.fantazm.com){:target="_blank"}. It was also my first solo full-stack game project, from conception to delivery. Parker - The Game is an online multiplayer turn-based team strategy game commissioned by [Event Creators](https://www.eventcreators.nl/){:target="_blank"} for their client [Parker Hannifin Netherlands](https://www.parker.com/portal/site/PARKER/menuitem.223a4a3cce02eb6315731910237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=c883f1069475e210VgnVCM10000048021dacRCRD&vgnextfmt=NL&vgnextfmt=NL){:target="_blank"}.
