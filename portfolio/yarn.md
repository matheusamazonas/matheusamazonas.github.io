I briefly worked on this project at Media Monks (now [Monks](https://www.monks.com)), as a game developer outsourced from [Fantazm](https://www.fantazm.com). The project told the story of cotton-spinning mills in Hong Kong using Virtual Reality. During the couple of weeks I joined the project for, I was responsible for feature development and bug fixes.

You can read more about the project on the Center for Heritage, Arts and Textile's [website](https://www.mill6chat.org/event/re-spinning-the-yarn-by-mediamonks-3/) and watch a short video about in on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZKWRQeU0RM).
