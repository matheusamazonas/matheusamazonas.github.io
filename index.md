Brazilian video game developer currently living in France. I have always been passionate about building, fixing, breaking and fixing things back again. First, there were toys. Later, computer hardware and software. Eventually, I invested my education on what I enjoyed the most and decided to study Computing Science. During my exchange study in the USA, I discovered game development and I have been hooked ever since. 

Nowadays, I apply my knowledge on software development and my gamer background to create fun, robust and performant video games and VR experiences.
